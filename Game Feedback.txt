Feedback on AppLab:
“It’s good, however, when I click on the sounds it plays until it’s over-- I think it should stop one sound if you click another.”

“I like the colors! I think it’d be cool if the button colors changed with the theme.”

“You could make a lot of money on the App Store doing that.”
