	Personally, the people I’ve received a majority of influence from were my softball coaches and my friends. Something all of my coaches always capitalized on was the idea of being apart of a team. When someone else is slacking or playing bad, the rest of the team will have to compensate until that player can be back up and above par. Especially with the hitting aspect of the game, it becomes a mental game rather than a physical one. Sometimes my coaches would be able to read me so well to the point they knew exactly what to tell me so that I could make contact with the ball. In the broader scheme of things, they showed me how valuable listening to praise as well as criticism can help you grow as a player and person.
	My friends, to me, have always been very important to me. Personally, I am closer and more open about my thoughts with my friends over my parents. I look for honesty and encouragement through them and have spent a lot of time building those relationships to get to the point where they are now. I believe it should be a two way street-- I would never ask something from them that I could not provide for them back, therefore, they are able to tell me what I need to hear over what I might want to hear.
